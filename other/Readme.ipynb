    "```python\n",
    "git push origin master\n",
    "```\n",
    "(This command MUST be done from the unix shell, in the terminal, because it will ask you for a user name and password for the repo. In Michael's example, the user name is mlamoureux, and of course he won't tell you his password.)\n"
